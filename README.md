### üöÄ Live Application Demo

This video shows the final application in action. The system uses a team of six specialized AI agents to process a user's query and generate a comprehensive, source-backed answer.

### üéØ Project Overview

**From Thesis to Application**: This project evolved from my **Thesis I (TCC1) at the Federal University of Piau√≠ (UFPI)**, where both the written article and the final presentation earned a **perfect 10/10 grade**. The work has since been expanded into this fully-functional, multi-agent Q&A system.

This is not just a search index; it's a sophisticated **multi-agent AI system** designed to deliver intelligent and reliable answers. When a user asks a question, a workflow is orchestrated between six specialized agents, each handling a critical part of the process from retrieval to final answer synthesis.

The system's foundation is a powerful **hybrid retrieval engine** that fuses dense (semantic) and sparse (lexical) search, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the 8.8M+ document MS MARCO dataset.

### üèóÔ∏è The Six-Agent Architecture

The system's intelligence is distributed across six collaborative agents. I've created a live, interactive webpage to visualize and explain the entire workflow and the technologies used.

#### Agent Roles:
1.  **üéØ The Coordinator Agent**: Analyzes the initial query to understand user intent and plans the optimal execution strategy for the other agents.
2.  **üîç The Retrieval Agent**: Executes the hybrid search plan, querying the high-performance FAISS and BM25 indices to find the most relevant source documents.
3.  **üî¨ The Content Analyzer Agent**: Scans the retrieved documents to identify and extract key themes and concepts, providing a summarized context.
4.  **üîß The Context Processor Agent**: intelligently selects and condenses the most critical information from the analyzed content, preparing a perfectly optimized context for the language model.
5.  **üß† The Answer Synthesizer Agent**: Takes the optimized context and uses a powerful generative model (like Gemini) to formulate a comprehensive, well-written, and coherent answer.
6.  **‚úÖ The Quality Validator Agent**: Assesses the generated answer for quality, relevance, and factual consistency against the source documents, assigning a final quality score.

### ‚ö° Core Engine: The Hybrid Retrieval System

The agents are powered by a best-in-class retrieval engine that was the focus of my 10/10 graded thesis. It combines a custom-optimized BM25 with a highly-tuned FAISS IVF index for semantic search.

#### Performance Metrics (on 6,980 MS MARCO Dev Queries)

| Method          | MAP ‚Üë      | Recall@10 ‚Üë | MRR@10 ‚Üë   | NDCG@10 ‚Üë  | Latency (s) ‚Üì |
| :-------------- | :--------: | :---------: | :--------: | :--------: | :-----------: |
| **Dense (FAISS)** | **95.14%** | **99.24%** | **95.29%** | **96.20%** | 55.8          |
| **Sparse (BM25)** | 81.24%   | 91.43%    | 81.61%   | 83.73%   | 59.2          |

### üõ†Ô∏è About This Code Repository

Please note: For proprietary reasons, this repository does **not** contain the full codebase for the multi-agent orchestration logic or the frontend application.

The code provided here is a clean, production-ready implementation of the **core hybrid retrieval engine** that powers the **Retrieval Agent**. It contains the complete, high-performance FAISS and BM25 systems developed for my thesis, demonstrating the foundational layer upon which the full application is built.
